    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p class="text-md text-gray-400">&emsp;I started getting into programming around 2016 and have learned many things since. Starting with <strong>Python</strong>, I dabbled in <strong>data science</strong> and <strong>gui applications</strong>. 
        <br>
        &emsp;I then got an <strong>Arduino</strong> starter kit and started learning <strong style="white-space: nowrap;">C/C++</strong> to go along with that. Many projects into the future, I've started expanding my reach, doing bare metal programming on <strong>AVR</strong> microcontrollers and dabbling in <strong>Discord bots</strong>. 
        <br>
        &emsp;My main focus is minimal sized and easy to use programs, be it <strong>Python</strong>, <strong style="white-space: nowrap;">C/C++</strong>, or <strong>JavaScript</strong> (and a few others).</p>
